This project was done in an Introduction to Web Development and has basic HTML/CSS file strucutres at four weeks. 
We were not yet introduced to the grid system, nor a formal framework but this was to help build understanding of some of the overall structures. 
Only the footer follows a more responsive design but details should be ironed out as I continue through the course.
